The purpose of this project is demonstrate competence in using npm and webpack, as well as further developing my skills in DOM manipulation and writing clean and modular JS code.

All the content on the website has been added via JavaScript, and a tab system has been implemented using event listeners to allow the user to switch between "Home", "Contact" and "Menu" views.
